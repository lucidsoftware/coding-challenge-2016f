		<h1>Swiss Bank Account<h1>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<div class="paragraph">
			Excentric multi-millionaire Thurston Howell III died in 1973. His vast fortune was held in a swiss bank account and his only heir, his son Gerald was never able to access the fortune because he could not find the account number amidst his father records. Gerald recently passed away and with his passing several teams of fortune hunters have begun searching for the secret account number hoping to be the first to claim Thurston's fortune. You have been contacted by a group who claims to hold the secret to finding the account number and are asking for your help. They have sent you a picture of a single page that appears to contain the specifications for a primitive (by modern standards) assembly language. This group claims to have possesion of a program that, when run, would output the bank account number.  Your job is to implement a VM to run specified language since no existing processor exists that can run this assembly language.

<pre>Specification
REGISTERS: 
	IP - Instruction Pointer, points to the next instruction to be executed, 000 at start
	R00, R01, R02, ..., R08 - 8 bit registers, initialized to zero at start
	CR - stored result of last CMP operation, can be >, =, <, initialized to = at start

INSTRUCTION FORMAT:
Each line of code will be formatted like:
NNN III OP1 OP2
Where NNN is the instruction number, starting at 000 and rising incrementally for each line
      III is a three letter instruction code, see below for instruction codes
      OP1 is the first parameter to the instruction, some instructions do not require this
      OP2 is the second parameter to the instruction, some instructions do not require this

INSTRUCTIONS:
   SET OP1 OP2 - load constant value specified by OP2 into register specified by OP1
   ADD OP1 OP2 - add value in register specified by OP2 to register specified by OP1, 
                 store result in register OP1
   CMP OP1 OP2 - compare value in register OP1 with value in register OP2, stores result
                 in CR
   JMP OP1     - set IP to instruction number OP1 which must be a constant value
   JIF OP1 OP2 - conditional jump.  OP1 must be one of GRE, LES, EQU, GRQ, LEQ NEQ where
                 GRE is >,  LES is <. EQU is =, GRQ is >=, LEQ is <= and NEQ is !=.  
                 Compares CR to specified condition and executes a jump to line 
                 OP2 if condition is met
   OUT OP1     - outputs a single character
   END         - end of the program, all programs must end with this instruction

Constant values can be in one of two forms:
   *  DDD where D is a numeral from 0-9.  0 -> 000, 37 -> 037
   *  'c' where c is any ascii character
